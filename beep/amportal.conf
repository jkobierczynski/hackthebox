<span id="line98"></span># If set to 'deviceanduser', Devices and Users will be administered seperately.  Devices (e.g. 
<span id="line99"></span># each individual line on a SIP phone) and Users (e.g. '101') will be configured 
<span id="line100"></span># independent of each other, allowing association of one User to many Devices, or allowing

<span id="line107"></span># Enable call waiting by default when an extension is created. Set to 'no' to if you don't want 
<span id="line108"></span># phones to be commissioned with call waiting already enabled. The user would then be required
<span id="line109"></span># to dial the CW feature code (*70 default) to enable their phone. Most installations should leave
<span id="line110"></span># this alone. It allows multi-line phones to receive multiple calls on their line appearances.
<span id="line111"></span>
<span id="line112"></span># CWINUSEBUSY=true|false
<span id="line113"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: true
<span id="line114"></span># For extensions that have CW enabled, report unanswered CW calls as 'busy' (resulting in busy 
<span id="line115"></span># voicemail greeting). If set to no, unanswered CW calls simply report as 'no-answer'.
<span id="line116"></span>
<span id="line117"></span># AMPBADNUMBER=true|false
<span id="line118"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: true
<span id="line119"></span># Generate the bad-number context which traps any bogus number or feature code and plays a
<span id="line120"></span># message to the effect. If you use the Early Dial feature on some Grandstream phones, you
<span id="line121"></span># will want to set this to false.
<span id="line122"></span>
<span id="line123"></span># AMPBACKUPSUDO=true|false
<span id="line124"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line125"></span># This option allows you to use sudo when backing up files. Useful ONLY when using AMPPROVROOT
<span id="line126"></span># Allows backup and restore of files specified in AMPPROVROOT, based on permissions in /etc/sudoers

<span id="line133"></span># CUSTOMASERROR=true|false
<span id="line134"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: true
<span id="line135"></span># If false, then the Destination Registry will not report unknown destinations as errors. This should be
<span id="line136"></span># left to the default true and custom destinations should be moved into the new custom apps registry.
<span id="line137"></span>
<span id="line138"></span># DYNAMICHINTS=true|false
<span id="line139"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line140"></span># If true, Core will not statically generate hints, but instead make a call to the AMPBIN php script, 
<span id="line141"></span># and generate_hints.php through an Asterisk's #exec call. This requires Asterisk.conf to be configured 
<span id="line142"></span># with "execincludes=yes" set in the [options] section.

<span id="line144"></span># XTNCONFLICTABORT=true|false
<span id="line145"></span># BADDESTABORT=true|false
<span id="line146"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line147"></span># Setting either of these to true will result in retrieve_conf aborting during a reload if an extension
<span id="line148"></span># conflict is detected or a destination is detected. It is usually better to allow the reload to go
<span id="line149"></span># through and then correct the problem but these can be set if a more strict behavior is desired.
<span id="line150"></span>
<span id="line151"></span># SERVERINTITLE=true|false
<span id="line152"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line153"></span># Precede browser title with the server name.
<span id="line154"></span>
<span id="line155"></span># USEDEVSTATE = true|false
<span id="line156"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line157"></span># If this is set, it assumes that you are running Asterisk 1.4 or higher and want to take advantage of the
<span id="line158"></span># func_devstate.c backport available from Asterisk 1.6. This allows custom hints to be created to support
<span id="line159"></span># BLF for server side feature codes such as daynight, followme, etc.
<span id="line160"></span>
<span id="line161"></span># MODULEADMINWGET=true|false
<span id="line162"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line163"></span># Module Admin normally tries to get its online information through direct file open type calls to URLs that
<span id="line164"></span># go back to the freepbx.org server. If it fails, typically because of content filters in firewalls that
<span id="line165"></span># don't like the way PHP formats the requests, the code will fall back and try a wget to pull the information.
<span id="line166"></span># This will often solve the problem. However, in such environment there can be a significant timeout before
<span id="line167"></span># the failed file open calls to the URLs return and there are often 2-3 of these that occur. Setting this
<span id="line168"></span># value will force FreePBX to avoid the attempt to open the URL and go straight to the wget calls.
<span id="line169"></span>
<span id="line170"></span># AMPDISABLELOG=true|false
<span id="line171"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: true

<span id="line176"></span># Where to log if enabled, SQL, LOG_SQL logs to old MySQL table, others are passed to syslog system to
<span id="line177"></span># determine where to log
<span id="line178"></span>
<span id="line179"></span># AMPENABLEDEVELDEBUG=true|false
<span id="line180"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line181"></span># Whether or not to include log messages marked as 'devel-debug' in the log system
<span id="line182"></span>
<span id="line183"></span># AMPMPG123=true|false 
<span id="line184"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: true
<span id="line185"></span># When set to false, the old MoH behavior is adopted where MP3 files can be loaded and WAV files converted
<span id="line186"></span># to MP3. The new default behavior assumes you have mpg123 loaded as well as sox and will convert MP3 files
<span id="line187"></span># to WAV. This is highly recommended as MP3 files heavily tax the system and can cause instability on a busy
<span id="line188"></span># phone system.
<span id="line189"></span>
<span id="line190"></span># CDR DB Settings: Only used if you don't use the default values provided by FreePBX.
<span id="line191"></span># CDRDBHOST: hostname of db server if not the same as AMPDBHOST
<span id="line192"></span># CDRDBPORT: Port number for db host 
<span id="line193"></span># CDRDBUSER: username to connect to db with if it's not the same as AMPDBUSER
<span id="line194"></span># CDRDBPASS: password for connecting to db if it's not the same as AMPDBPASS
<span id="line195"></span># CDRDBNAME: name of database used for cdr records
<span id="line196"></span># CDRDBTYPE: mysql or postgres mysql is default
<span id="line197"></span># CDRDBTABLENAME: Name of the table in the db where the cdr is stored cdr is default 
<span id="line198"></span>
<span id="line199"></span># AMPVMUMASK=mask 
<span id="line200"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: 077 
<span id="line201"></span># Defaults to 077 allowing only the asterisk user to have any permission on VM files. If set to something
<span id="line202"></span># like 007, it would allow the group to have permissions. This can be used if setting apache to a different
<span id="line203"></span># user then asterisk, so that the apache user (and thus ARI) can have access to read/write/delete the
<span id="line204"></span># voicemail files. If changed, some of the voicemail directory structures may have to be manually changed.
<span id="line205"></span>
<span id="line206"></span># DASHBOARD_STATS_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds
<span id="line207"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: 6
<span id="line208"></span># DASHBOARD_INFO_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds
<span id="line209"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: 20
<span id="line210"></span># These can be used to change the refresh rate of the System Status Panel. Most of

<span id="line214"></span># ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true|false
<span id="line215"></span>ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true
<span id="line216"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line217"></span># If set to true, FreePBX will check if you have chan_dadhi installed. If so, it will
<span id="line218"></span># automatically use all your ZAP configuration settings (devices and trunks) and
<span id="line219"></span># silently convert them, under the covers, to DAHDI so no changes are needed. The
<span id="line220"></span># GUI will continue to refer to these as ZAP but it will use the proper DAHDI channels.
<span id="line221"></span># This will also keep Zap Channel DIDs working.
<span id="line222"></span>
<span id="line223"></span># CHECKREFERER=true|false
<span id="line224"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: true
<span id="line225"></span># When set to the default value of true, all requests into FreePBX that might possibly add/edit/delete
<span id="line226"></span># settings will be validated to assure the request is coming from the server. This will protect the system
<span id="line227"></span># from CSRF (cross site request forgery) attacks. It will have the effect of preventing legitimately entering
<span id="line228"></span># URLs that could modify settings which can be allowed by changing this field to false.
<span id="line229"></span>
<span id="line230"></span># USEQUEUESTATE=true|false

<span id="line232"></span># Setting this flag will generate the required dialplan to integrate with the following Asterisk patch:
<span id="line233"></span># https://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=15168
<span id="line234"></span># This feature is planned for a future 1.6 release but given the existence of the patch can be used prior. Once
<span id="line235"></span># the release version is known, code will be added to automatically enable this format in versions of Asterisk
<span id="line236"></span># that support it.
<span id="line237"></span>
<span id="line238"></span># USEGOOGLEDNSFORENUM=true|false
<span id="line239"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line240"></span># Setting this flag will generate the required global variable so that enumlookup.agi will use Google DNS
<span id="line241"></span># 8.8.8.8 when performing an ENUM lookup. Not all DNS deals with NAPTR record, but Google does. There is a
<span id="line242"></span># drawback to this as Google tracks every lookup. If you are not comfortable with this, do not enable this
<span id="line243"></span># setting. Please read Google FAQ about this: http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/faq.html#privacy
<span id="line244"></span>

<span id="line257"></span>
<span id="line258"></span># DISABLECUSTOMCONTEXTS=true|false
<span id="line259"></span># DEFAULT VALUE: false
<span id="line260"></span># Normally FreePBX auto-generates a custom context that may be usable for adding custom dialplan to modify the
<span id="line261"></span># normal behavior of FreePBX. It takes a good understanding of how Asterisk processes these includes to use
<span id="line262"></span># this and in many of the cases, there is no useful application. All includes will result in a WARNING in the
<span id="line263"></span># Asterisk log if there is no context found to include though it results in no errors. If you know that you
<span id="line264"></span># want the includes, you can set this to true. If you comment it out FreePBX will revert to legacy behavior
<span id="line265"></span># and include the contexts.
